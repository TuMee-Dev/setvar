# Implementation Notes and Responses

## Responses to Requirements

### 1. Multiple Shells Support
✓ Implemented - The tool supports bash, zsh, and sh, and can update all common shell configuration files.

### 2. Backup Feature
✓ Implemented - Backups are ON by default during development. They're stored as zip files in `~/.config/setvar/backups/` with metadata including timestamps and descriptions. Use `--no-backup` to disable.

### 3. Quoted Values Handling
✓ Implemented - The tool properly handles quoted values and special characters. It intelligently determines when quotes are needed and escapes characters appropriately.

### 4. Confirmation with Old/New Values
✓ Implemented - Shows old and new values before making changes. Use `-y` flag to skip confirmation.

### 5. Command Line Best Practices
✓ Followed Unix philosophy and modern CLI guidelines:
- Clear help with examples
- Dry-run mode (`-n`)
- Verbose mode (`-v`)
- Version flag (`-V`)
- Human-friendly output

### 6. Brew Install Scope on macOS
Brew installations on macOS:
- **User installs** (Apple Silicon): `/opt/homebrew` - only for current user
- **System installs** (Intel): `/usr/local` - potentially accessible by all users
- Python installed via brew is typically user-specific
- This tool modifies user shell configs (~/.bashrc, etc.), so it's inherently per-user

### 7. Verbose Mode and Dry Run
✓ Implemented:
- `-v/--verbose`: Shows detailed operations and file modifications
- `-n/--dry-run`: Preview all changes without applying them

### 8. List Variables Across Shells
✓ Implemented with sync checking:
```bash
# Basic list
setvar list

# Check sync status (highlights differences)
setvar list --sync-check

# Filter with patterns
setvar list --pattern "*_PORT"
```

### Import/Export with Filters
✓ Implemented:
```bash
# Export with filters
setvar export --keys "*_PORT" "TESTVAR_*" --output filtered.json

# Import specific variables
setvar import config.env --keys "DB_*" "API_*"
```

### Shell Syncing
✓ Implemented:
```bash
# Sync all variables
setvar sync --from zsh --to all

# Sync specific shells
setvar sync --from bash --to zsh sh

# Sync with filters
setvar sync --from zsh --to bash --keys "*_CONFIG" "APP_*"
```

## Additional Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Shell Detection**: Detects current shell if not specified
2. **Smart File Selection**: Updates existing variable locations, creates files if needed
3. **Multiple Export Formats**: JSON, .env, shell script
4. **Backup Management**: Create, list, and restore backups
5. **Pattern Matching**: Supports wildcards for filtering variables

## Design Decisions

1. **Python Implementation**: Cross-platform, easy to maintain, good for text processing
2. **File Preservation**: Updates variables in-place, preserves file structure
3. **Safety First**: Confirmations, backups, and dry-run by default
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new shells or features

## Future Enhancements

1. **Shell Completion**: Add bash/zsh completion scripts
2. **Config Profiles**: Save/load different sets of variables
3. **Remote Sync**: Sync variables across machines
4. **Encryption**: Secure storage for sensitive values
5. **History**: Track changes over time
